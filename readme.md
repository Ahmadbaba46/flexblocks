Flexblocks is a lightweight, easy-to-learn CSS layout system, designed to fix the two biggest pain points of new CSS users: alignment syntax and margin edgecases. For a detailed explanation of how Flexblocks is different, check out the [announcement blog post](https://lord.io/blog/2016/flexblocks/).

## Installing Flexblocks

Installing Flexblocks is simple â€” if you're just using plain CSS, just download `dist/flexblocks-responsive.css`. If you're a SCSS user, download the contents of `src`, and just `include` the contents of `flexblocks-responsive.scss`.

## Using Flexblocks

Using Flexblocks is easy! Here's a guide, click to enlarge.

## Customizing Flexblocks

If you change the contents of `flexblocks-responsive.scss`, you can update the default widths of the `gap` classes, and add an optional prefix to all class names. To recompile the SCSS into CSS, you can run `npm install; npm run build`.
